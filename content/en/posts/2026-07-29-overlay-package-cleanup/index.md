Over the past month 162 packages got a new version, 60 packages were added, 38 were removed and 5 were renamed or moved to another category. The overlay went from 468 to 490 packages.

## Renamed or Moved

The five packages below were renamed or moved. Portage applies this on `emerge --sync`, so nothing has to be done by hand:

| Old name | New name |
| --- | --- |
| `app-i18n/fcitx5-vinput` | `app-i18n/fcitx-vinput` |
| `www-apps/cherry-studio-bin` | `app-misc/cherry-studio-bin` |
| `www-apps/dufs` | `www-servers/dufs` |
| `www-apps/follow-bin` | `www-apps/folo-bin` |
| `net-proxy/clash-verge-bin` | `net-proxy/clash-verge-rev-bin` |

## Now Provided by ::gentoo

::gentoo carries the same or a newer version of the seven packages below, so this overlay no longer keeps a second copy. After syncing they come from ::gentoo. Installed copies need no action, and upgrades follow ::gentoo from now on:

- `dev-libs/libdatrie`
- `dev-libs/libthai`
- `dev-libs/libratbag`
- `gui-libs/libdecor`
- `media-fonts/smiley-sans`
- `sys-fs/jmtpfs`
- `media-video/amdgpu-pro-amf`

## Removed: Upstream Gone or Unmaintained

These ten were removed because upstream disappeared or archived the project, or because nobody maintains them any more:

- `app-containers/distrobox-boost`
- `dev-db/dbeaver-bin`
- `dev-python/pytube`
- `net-misc/bbdown-bin`
- `net-misc/biliup-rs`
- `net-print/kyodialog`
- `net-proxy/mihomo-party-bin`
- `net-proxy/tun2socks`
- `x11-misc/snapd-xdg-open`
- `x11-themes/fcitx-breeze`

## Removed: Long Unmaintained

The twenty-one below were all added by the same packager, went unmaintained for a long time and had no second maintainer, so they were removed together:

- `app-doc/reeknote`
- `app-editors/flowblade`
- `app-office/evernote-repack`
- `app-text/tre`
- `app-text/wik`
- `app-text/wiki2man_on_rust`
- `dev-python/exifread`
- `dev-python/iptcinfo3`
- `dev-python/mwparserfromhell`
- `dev-python/pywikibot`
- `dev-vcs/git-remote-mediawiki`
- `games-emulation/conty`
- `games-fps/openarena`
- `games-fps/openarena-bin`
- `games-roguelike/tsl`
- `games-strategy/zedonline-bin`
- `mate-base/caja-bin`
- `media-sound/rew`
- `media-sound/yamusic-tui-bin`
- `net-im/kotatogram-bin`
- `x11-themes/kvantum-black`

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
An installed copy of a removed package stays behind as an orphan and can be removed with `emerge --unmerge`.
{{< /callout >}}

## Replacement

Upstream moved the `net-misc/biliup-rs` code to [biliup/biliup](https://github.com/biliup/biliup), so the replacement is `net-misc/biliup-bin`, the prebuilt binary from that repository.

## More Packages Masked for Removal

More packages are masked for removal. The reason and the removal date for each are in [`profiles/package.mask`](https://github.com/gentoo-zh/overlay/blob/master/profiles/package.mask). If you still use one of them, tell us before its removal date.
